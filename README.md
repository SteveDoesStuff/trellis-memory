# Trellis Memory Game
A memory game for the Adafruit Trellis M4

## How to Play
1. Upload to your Trellis M4 using the Arduino IDE
2. Connect headphones or a speaker to the audio out
3. When the game starts you will see the LEDs fill red and blue from either side. This indicates the two players. The red player always goes first
4. Taking turns, press any two buttons to reveal the colours. If using headphones or a speaker, you will also hear an audio clip assigned to each colour to help differentiate simialar colours
5. If you find a pair, the LEDs will blink indicating a match and you get to go again
6. Once all of the pairs have been found (there are 16 unique pairs) the LEDs will light up to indicate who won. In the case of a tie, the LEDs will fill with red and blue from either side
7. Play again!
